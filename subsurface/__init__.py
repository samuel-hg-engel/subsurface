Subsurface Microstructure Uncertainty Quantification (SMUQ)
Author: Samuel Engel

Python tools to generate Representative Volume Elements (RVE) for Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Modelling (CP-FEM).
The package uses Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) to perturb seed locations in Voronoi tessalations. 
Similiar methods are used to shuffle crystallographic orientations to bespoke textures.
